Title: PoC: Detecting RSA in DCS-932L Firmware of Dlink (Novi Hogeschool Assessment)

Purpose: This Python script provides a foundational demonstration of how to automate the initial steps of searching for hardcoded credentials within the Dlink DCS-932L Firmware. It's designed as an educational Proof of Concept (PoC) for a Novi Hogeschool assessment.

Usage: To use the provided script, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system.

   
Linux Install Python:
```
sudo apt install python3
```
Mac Install Python:
```
brew install python
```
2. Install Required Modules: You need to install the `requests` module if it's not already installed. You can do this using pip, Python's package manager, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```
3. Run the Script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `exploit2.py` file, and run the script using the following command:
   ```
   python3 exploit2.py   
   ```
4. Check Output: After running the script, it will download the DCS932L Firmware, extract its contents, locate the `/etc_ro/serverkey.pem` file, read its content, and write it to a new file named `rsa.txt`. You can find the `rsa.txt` file in the same directory where you ran the script.

5. Review Output: Open the `rsa.txt` file to review the contents of the `/etc_ro/serverkey.pem` file, which was retrieved.

How it Works

Downloads a Repository: The script downloads a specified GitHub repository as a ZIP file.
Extracts the Archive: It extracts the contents of the downloaded ZIP file.
Locates a Target File: The script navigates the extracted file structure to locate a specific file (in this example, 'etc_ro/serverkey.pem').
Copies File Content: The contents of the target file are copied to a new file ('rsa.txt') for further manual inspection.

Important Notes

Ensure you have the requests and zipfile libraries installed (pip install requests zipfile).
Disclaimer: This script is intended for educational use within the scope of a Novi Hogeschool assessment.  Always use code responsibly and ethically when interacting with GitHub repositories.
